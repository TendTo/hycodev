    paragraph1:
      "The primary objective of this project is to develop an industrial case study for REF2028 in the area of safety-critical systems with a particular focus on energy distribution systems in collaboration with Smart Grid Lab at Newcastle and Siemens in Germany. This project will provide a new approach to ensuring the safe operation of safety-critical systems (e.g., blackout-free, minimum-cost energy supply) using data gathered from the system. This project will bridge the gap between formal abstraction-based methods and data-driven analysis while providing certification on satisfying the (safety) requirements.",
    paragraph2:
      "The significant novelty of our project is that we provide the first approach that can guarantee the runtime safety of autonomous systems in safety-critical applications. By the end of this project, we have developed the first data-driven mechanism that can be applied to large-scale smart energy distribution systems while providing probabilistic guarantees (confidence values) on the satisfaction of the requirements. We will develop a REF impact case study in collaboration with Siemens using the experiments performed in the Smart Grid Lab (facilitated by the PI’s EPSRC New Investigator Award, CodeCPS). ",

    title: "Formal Verification and Synthesis for Multi-Agent Systems",
    level: "Multiple PhD positions at Newcastle University, UK",
    location: "Newcastle University, UK",
    deadline: "",
    paragraph1:
      "These two positions are part of the SymAware project, which is a €4m project awarded by the European Innovation Council (EIC) to perform cutting-edge research and to achieve breakthroughs in the strategic area of awareness. SymAware will address the fundamental need for a new conceptual framework for situational awareness in multi-agent systems that is compatible with the internal models and specifications of robot agents and that enables the safe simultaneous operation of collaborating autonomous agents and humans. ",
    paragraph2:
      "The framework of SymAware will provide the logical characterisation and integrative formal reasoning of interdependent awareness dimensions, including knowledge, spatiotemporal, risk and social dimensions. The project will help understand and improve the safety of unmanned aircraft traffic management and autonomous vehicles.",
