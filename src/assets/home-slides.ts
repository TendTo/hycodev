This involves tackling challenges related to control-theoretic considerations such as disturbances and system structure; model-based and data-driven approaches; uncertainty and missing prior knowledge; stochasticity; and other.",

As we phase away from large-scale generation devices, we will need nimble controllers that can act quickly to mitigate any issues that arise, as well as approaches which can scale to the size of these massive power systems.

First line treatment is pharmacological, but side effects are common, and it is estimated that up to a third of patients will not be seizure free on medication. Some of these patients may be suitable for resection surgery, if a suitable surgical target can be identified with sufficient confidence. Other modalities include electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve (VNS) and, to a lesser extent, direct stimulation of the brain itself.",
